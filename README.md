Controlling a NeoPixel LED strip using Raspberry Pi / Homebridge

I wanted to control a WS2812 LED strip aka a NeoPixel LED strip (adafruit) to be controlled using homebridge and a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

See the Python source in pixelServer.py

I use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-neopixel package for homebridge.

Others have used intermediate solutions including the ESP8266:
